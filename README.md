# CoCoSDCPakFlasher
A crude Linux script to create a CoCo SDC disk image containing the binary of your choice in the form of a LOADM-able file as well as a BASIC program which can be used to flash it to the selected bank in your CoCo SDC.

This script is most useful for writing a Program Pak image file found on the Color Computer Archive to a flash bank on the CoCo SDC so you can play it on real hardware with (relative) ease.

## Requirements

* A Tandy Color Computer (1, 2, or 3) with at least 32K of RAM.
* A CoCo SDC with an available flash bank and a SD card onto which you can store disk iamges.
* A *nix-like operating system with the following installed: The Bourne Again Shell (BASH), dd, and the ToolShed tools (http://www.nitros9.org/tools.html).
* The ToolShed tools must already be in your PATH.

## Usage

## Support
Like every other thing I create, this project is technically unsupported.  This project is crude and probably has bugs/limitations/quirks that either didn't affect me or I didn't care to address.  I'm sharing it because I figured it might help someone or at least demonstrate a process.  I'm happy to take questions, but please keep in mind this is my hobby and I may take a long time to answer, if I do at all. :)  

If you have want feature enhancements, feel free to fork the project, make your changes, and submit a PR if you think it would be a good addition to the mainline project.  Remember to leave original author credit in place if you fork the project.  In advance: many thanks.
